Q) PHPFM returns a lot of errors similar to "Notice: Undefined variable:
   _SERVER in /path/to/phpfm/index.php on line X". What is wrong?
A) PHPFM requires PHP 4.1.0 or higher since the $_SERVER, $_GET, $_POST
   and $_COOKIE superglobals were introduced in 4.1.0.

Q) I run PHPFM from a Linux/UNIX server and everything fails. What is wrong?
A) This is probably caused by PHP running in safe-mode. This is very common
   for webhosts. There is nothing you can do about this if the server is not
   yours, other than CHMOD'ing files and folders to 777. If you are running
   PHPFM on your own server, you should access the php.ini file and disable
   safe-mode.

Q) Is there / will there be multi-user support in PHPFM?
A) There is a 3rd party version that has this functionality located here:

	been officially tested, thus it is not supported in any way.
