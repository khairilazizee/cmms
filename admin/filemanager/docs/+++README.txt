This script, was written by raz0 at http://phpfm.zalon.dk.  At this time, 

he, nor http://phpfm.zalon.dk, is no longer officially supporting the 

script or providing updates. Consequently, we have obtained permission to 

redistribute the script with a new graphics package as well as a handful 

of minor code updates.  


If you need support (we do not offer email support), you can post on the 

following forums:  http://wwww.codingforums.com 

Please note that the original developer, as well as Big Lick Media, has not

placed a high priority on supporting PHPFM.  We are confident, however,

that given the amount of time PHPFM's current version has been stable

coupled with the sheer amount of domains it has been successfully 

deployed upon, that if you follow the installation procedures in detail

and make certain your web host passes all of the requirements documented

in requirements.txt, support should be rare.
 

To reiterate, all feature requests and are considered but are not a lock 

to be implemented.


Thank you for your understanding.

Big Lick Media
