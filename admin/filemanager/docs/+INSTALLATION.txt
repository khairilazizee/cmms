Installing PHPFM:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need support (we do not offer email support), you can post on the 
following forums:  http://wwww.codingforums.com

Installing on your own Windows workstation:
-----------------------------------------------
 1) Make sure that your webserver has PHP 4.1.0 or higher installed.
 2) Unzip the downloaded archive into your the document root of your webserver Make sure
    you maintain directory structure.
 3) Open "config.inc.php" in the directory "conf" with a text editor and set the home
    directory, username and password (default is file/manager). Save the file and close the text editor.
 4) Start up your internet browser and input the URL to PHPFM. It should look like this:
    "http://<your-host>/<path-to-phpfm>/". A sample URL would look like this:
    "http://localhost/phpfm/".
 5) You should now see the login screen.

Installing remotely on a Windows server:
-----------------------------------------------
 1) Make sure that the webserver has PHP 4.1.0 or higher installed.
 2) Unzip the downloaded archive to a temporary folder. Be sure to extract subdirectories
    as well.
 3) Open "config.inc.php" in the directory "conf" with a text editor and set the home
    directory, username and password (default is file/manager). Save the file and close the text editor.
 4) Upload all files, including all subdirectories, to the server (e.g. via FTP).
 5) Start up your internet browser and input the URL to PHPFM. It should look like this:
    "http://<your-host>/<path-to-phpfm>/". A sample URL would look like this:
    "http://www.some-site.com/phpfm/".
 6) You should now see the login screen.
 
 
 
 
Configuring PHPFM:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All configuration of PHPFM is done in the file "config.inc.php" which is located
in the folder entitled "conf". Just use a normal text editor like notepad for windows and
nano or gnotepad for linux.

$home_directory is the root directory of PHPFM. This is where you will start browsing
  from. You cannot browse out of this directory. Use forward slashes instead of back-
  slashes and remember a trailing slash! For instance "d:\path\to\root" would become
  "d:/path/to/root/".

$language chooses which language is used by PHPFM. To create a new language, you
  will have to make a copy of "english.inc.php" in the directory "lang" and translate
  all the strings. Then name the new file something like "german.inc.php", open
  "config.inc.php" again and set $language to "german" or whatever you called the new
  file.

$session_save_path chooses where the session (login) data is stored. For *NIX systems
  (i.e. LINUX, UNIX etc.) this should be set to "/tmp/". On WINDOWS based systems this
  should be set to the temporary directory for windows. This is often "c:/windows/temp"
  on Windows 9X systems and "c:/winnt/temp" on Windows NT, 2000 or XP systems.
  *** Note, you should only change this if you are experiencing problems!

$phpfm_auth chooses whether you will have to enter a username and password to use PHPFM.
  It can be set to either TRUE or FALSE.

$username is the username needed to login when $phpfm_auth is set to TRUE and $password
  is the password.

$AllowCreate, $AllowEdit etc. chooses what the users of PHPFM are allowed to do. It
  should be easy enough to guess what each variable will allow/disallow. Notice that
  they can be set to either TRUE or FALSE.

$IconArray is an array containing first an icon and then the filetypes or extensions
  belonging to it. Each filetype or extension is seperated by a whitespace.

$EditableFiles contains all the filetypes or extensions which are editable by PHPFM's
  text editor, each seperated by a whitespace.

$ViewableFiles contains all the filetypes or extensions which are viewable by PHPFM's
  image viewer, each seperated by a whitespace.

$ModifiedFormat is the format of the last modification date of files. It is in date()
  format. See http://www.php.net/date for more information.

$ZoomArray contains the different zoom levels used by PHPFM's image viewer. Notice that
  you cannot change the base zoom level (100%).

$hide_file_extension contains all the extensions of the files, which are hidden. To add
  more extensions, just add the extensions below those, which are already there. For
  instance if you would like to hide all ".txt" files, you would add "txt", below "bar".
  Just remeber the trailing comma.

$hide_file_string contain "strings" or parts of filenames to hide. For instance "secret"
  would hide the files "secret.txt" or "asecretfile.php" or "file.secret".

$hide_directory_string is identical to $hide_file_string except that it hides directories
  instead of files.
